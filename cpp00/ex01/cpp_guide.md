1. Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
**What are Classes?**  
Classes are user-defined data types that encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data. They're the foundation of object-oriented programming (OOP).

**Looking at your PhoneBook class (reference PhoneBook.hpp, lines 11-30), we can see the basic structure:**

```cpp
class PhoneBook {
private:
    // Data members (attributes)
    Contact contacts[8];
    int count;
    int oldest;

public:
    // Member functions (methods)
    PhoneBook();
    void addContact();
    void searchContact();
};
```

**Understanding Classes**  
A class in C++ serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. A method, also known as a member function, is a function that is defined within a class and operates on the data members of that class. Each class can have its own attributes (data members) and methods that define its behavior. 

When you create an object of a class, you are instantiating that class, which means you are creating a specific instance of it with its own set of data.

**The PhoneBook Class**  
The `PhoneBook` class is designed to manage a collection of contacts. It contains an array of `Contact` objects, which represent individual entries in the phone book. The `count` attribute keeps track of the number of contacts currently stored in the phone book. 

The `contacts` array and the `count` and `oldest` attributes are declared as private. This means they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. The reason for making them private is to encapsulate the data and protect it from unauthorized access or modification. By restricting access, we ensure that the integrity of the data is maintained and that it can only be manipulated through the public member functions of the class.

In contrast, public members are accessible from outside the class. They are used to define the interface through which other parts of the program can interact with the class. This distinction between private and public is fundamental in object-oriented programming, as it allows for controlled access to the class's internal state while exposing only the necessary functionality to the outside world.

The class provides the following member functions:
- **PhoneBook()**: A constructor that initializes the phone book, setting the initial count of contacts to zero and the oldest index to zero.
- **addContact()**: A method to add a new contact to the phone book.
- **searchContact()**: A method to search for a specific contact within the phone book.

This structure allows for organized management of contact information.

**Key OOP Concepts:**

**Encapsulation**  
Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class)
Hiding internal details using access specifiers (private, public, protected)
Access Specifiers
private: Only accessible within the class
public: Accessible from anywhere
protected: Accessible in the class and its derived classes
Constructors
Example from your code (PhoneBook.cpp, line 31):

```cpp
PhoneBook::PhoneBook() : count(0), oldest(0) {}
```

**String Handling**  
C++ has a string class instead of char arrays
Example from your code (Contact.hpp, lines 12-16):

```cpp
std::string firstName;
std::string lastName;
```

**References**  
C++ introduces references as an alternative to pointers:

void function(int& x)  // Reference parameter
void function(int* x)  // Pointer parameter (C-style)

**Function Overloading**  
C++ allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters:

```cpp
void print(int x);
void print(std::string x);
void print(double x);
```

3. Memory Management
**New vs Malloc**  
C:

```c
int* ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
free(ptr);
```

C++:

```cpp
int* ptr = new int;
delete ptr;
```

**4. Header Files**  
Header Guards
Your code demonstrates proper use of header guards (Contact.hpp, lines 1-3):

```cpp
#ifndef CONTACT_HPP
#define CONTACT_HPP
// ... code ...
#endif
```

**Namespaces**  
C++ introduces namespaces to avoid naming conflicts:

```cpp
std::cout   // 'cout' in the 'std' namespace
std::string // 'string' in the 'std' namespace
```

**Best Practices**  
**Resource Management**  
Use constructors for initialization
Use destructors for cleanup
Consider RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
Const Correctness
Mark methods that don't modify object state as const
Use const references for parameters when possible
Member Initialization
Use initialization lists in constructors
Initialize members in the order they're declared
Your phonebook project is a good example of these concepts in action, showing:
Class organization (PhoneBook and Contact classes)
Encapsulation (private data members, public interface)
Standard library usage (std::string, std::cout)
Header organization
