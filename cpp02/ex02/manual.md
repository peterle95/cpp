### Overview of the Program

This program implements a `Fixed` class that represents fixed-point numbers. Fixed-point representation is a way to store numbers that have a fixed number of digits after the decimal point. This is useful in scenarios where floating-point precision is not required or where performance is critical.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Header Files and Class Definition**:
   - The program includes necessary headers and defines the `Fixed` class in `Fixed.hpp`.
   - The class contains private members and public methods for constructing, manipulating, and displaying fixed-point numbers.

2. **Private Members**:
   - `_fixedPointValue`: An integer that stores the fixed-point value.
   - `_fractionalBits`: A constant that defines how many bits are used for the fractional part (set to 8).

3. **Constructors**:
   - `Fixed()`: Default constructor initializes `_fixedPointValue` to 0.
   - `Fixed(const int n)`: Converts an integer to a fixed-point value by shifting left (multiplying by 2^8).
   - `Fixed(const float n)`: Converts a float to a fixed-point value by multiplying by 2^8 and rounding.

4. **Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator**:
   - `Fixed(const Fixed &src)`: Initializes a new `Fixed` object as a copy of another.
   - `operator=(const Fixed &rhs)`: Assigns one `Fixed` object to another, ensuring self-assignment is handled.

5. **Destructor**:
   - `~Fixed()`: Cleans up when a `Fixed` object goes out of scope. In this case, it does nothing special since there are no dynamic allocations.

6. **Member Functions**:
   - `getRawBits()`: Returns the raw fixed-point value.
   - `setRawBits(int const raw)`: Sets the raw fixed-point value.
   - `toFloat()`: Converts the fixed-point value back to a float.
   - `toInt()`: Converts the fixed-point value to an integer.

7. **Operator Overloading**:
   - Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`) allow for comparing `Fixed` objects.
   - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) allow for mathematical operations between `Fixed` objects.
   - Increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators are overloaded for both pre- and post-increment/decrement.

8. **Static Member Functions**:
   - `min()` and `max()` functions return the minimum and maximum of two `Fixed` objects, respectively.

9. **Stream Operator Overloading**:
   - The `operator<<` is overloaded to allow easy printing of `Fixed` objects using `std::cout`.

### Main Function (`main.cpp`)

1. **Creating Fixed Objects**:
   - `Fixed a;`: Creates a default `Fixed` object `a` initialized to 0.
   - `Fixed const b(Fixed(5.05f) * Fixed(2));`: Creates a constant `Fixed` object `b` by multiplying two `Fixed` objects (5.05 and 2).

2. **Outputting Values**:
   - The program uses `std::cout` to print the values of `a` and `b` at various stages:
     - Initially, `a` is printed (should be 0).
     - The pre-increment operator is used to increment `a` and print it.
     - The post-increment operator is used to print `a` before and after incrementing.

3. **Using the `max` Function**:
   - The program prints the maximum of `a` and `b` using the `Fixed::max()` function.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

### Important Concepts

- **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: This program demonstrates how to implement fixed-point arithmetic, which is crucial in systems where floating-point operations are too costly or imprecise.
- **Operator Overloading**: The use of operator overloading allows for intuitive manipulation of custom objects, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.
- **Encapsulation**: The `Fixed` class encapsulates its data and provides public methods to interact with that data, adhering to object-oriented programming principles.
- **Memory Management**: Although this program does not use dynamic memory allocation, understanding constructors, destructors, and copy assignment is essential for managing resources in C++.

### Conclusion

This program provides a solid foundation for understanding fixed-point arithmetic in C++. It showcases key programming concepts such as class design, operator overloading, and encapsulation, making it a valuable learning resource for C++ developers.
