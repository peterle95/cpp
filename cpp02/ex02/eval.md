## Project Analysis

### 1. File Purpose and Functionality
The project implements a `Fixed` class that represents fixed-point numbers, which are useful for applications requiring precise decimal representation without the overhead of floating-point arithmetic. The class provides various functionalities, including constructors, operator overloads, and conversion methods, allowing for intuitive manipulation of fixed-point values.

### 2. Technical Implementation Details
The implementation consists of several files:
- **`Fixed.hpp`**: Header file defining the `Fixed` class and its member functions.
- **`Fixed.cpp`**: Implementation file containing the definitions of the methods declared in `Fixed.hpp`.
- **`main.cpp`**: Contains the main function to demonstrate the usage of the `Fixed` class.
- **`Makefile`**: Automates the build process for compiling the project.

#### Key Classes and Functions
- **`Fixed` Class**: 
  - **Private Members**:
    - `_fixedPointValue`: Stores the fixed-point value as an integer.
    - `_fractionalBits`: A constant defining the number of bits for the fractional part (set to 8).
  - **Constructors**:
    - `Fixed()`: Initializes `_fixedPointValue` to 0.
    - `Fixed(const int n)`: Converts an integer to a fixed-point value.
    - `Fixed(const float n)`: Converts a float to a fixed-point value.
  - **Member Functions**:
    - `getRawBits()`: Returns the raw fixed-point value.
    - `setRawBits(int const raw)`: Sets the raw fixed-point value.
    - `toFloat()`: Converts the fixed-point value back to a float.
    - `toInt()`: Converts the fixed-point value to an integer.
  - **Operator Overloading**: Supports comparison and arithmetic operations, as well as increment and decrement operations.
  - **Static Functions**: `min()` and `max()` return the minimum and maximum of two `Fixed` objects.

### 3. Problems Encountered and Solutions
- **Division by Zero**: Implemented error handling in the division operator to prevent crashes by checking if the divisor is zero and returning a default `Fixed` object instead.
- **Operator Overloading Complexity**: Ensured that all operators were correctly overloaded to maintain expected behavior, which required careful testing of each operator.

### 4. Memory Management Considerations
- The project does not utilize dynamic memory allocation, thus avoiding memory leaks. The constructors and destructors are straightforward, ensuring that resources are managed effectively.
- The use of copy constructors and assignment operators is implemented to handle object copying correctly, preventing shallow copies.

### 5. Potential Evaluation Questions
1. **What is the purpose of the `Fixed` class?**
   - The `Fixed` class is designed to represent fixed-point numbers, allowing for precise arithmetic operations without the pitfalls of floating-point representation.

2. **How does the class handle division by zero?**
   - The division operator checks if the divisor is zero and outputs an error message while returning a default `Fixed` object to prevent crashes.

3. **What are the advantages of using fixed-point arithmetic?**
   - Fixed-point arithmetic provides better performance and precision in scenarios where floating-point operations are not necessary, such as in embedded systems or financial calculations.

4. **Can you explain the operator overloading in the `Fixed` class?**
   - Operator overloading allows instances of the `Fixed` class to be manipulated using standard arithmetic and comparison operators, making the code more intuitive and readable.

5. **What did you learn from implementing this project?**
   - I gained a deeper understanding of fixed-point arithmetic, operator overloading, and the importance of memory management in C++. This project also enhanced my skills in designing and implementing classes in C++.

### 6. Additional Features or Improvements
- The project could be extended to include more complex arithmetic operations or additional mathematical functions, such as square root or trigonometric functions, to enhance the functionality of the `Fixed` class.

### Conclusion
This project serves as a solid foundation for understanding fixed-point arithmetic in C++. It showcases key programming concepts such as class design, operator overloading, and encapsulation, making it a valuable learning resource for C++ developers.
