## Common Questions Answered in Comments

### Exercise 00

1. **Why std::map instead of std::vector?**
   - Sorted by key automatically
   - Binary search (O(log n)) instead of linear scan
   - lower_bound() is efficient

2. **How does lower_bound() work for dates?**
   - Returns iterator to first element >= search key
   - If exact date exists, use it
   - If not, use closest earlier date

3. **Why validate dates so carefully?**
   - Dates before 2009 have no Bitcoin data
   - Invalid dates (Feb 30) must be rejected
   - Leap year calculation is tricky

### Exercise 01

1. **Why pop right operand first?**
   - Stack is LIFO (Last In, First Out)
   - Most recent value (right operand) is on top
   - Must pop in reverse order of operations

2. **Why use std::stack for RPN?**
   - LIFO is perfect for postfix evaluation
   - O(1) operations (push, pop, top)
   - Simple and efficient

3. **What makes RPN different from infix?**
   - No operator precedence needed
   - No parentheses needed
   - Unambiguous evaluation order
