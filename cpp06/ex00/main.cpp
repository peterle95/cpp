#include "ScalarConverter.hpp"
#include <iostream>

/*TASK:
Write a class ScalarConverter that will contain only one static method "convert"
that will take as a parameter a string representation of a C++ literal in its most common
form and output its value in the following series of scalar types:
• char
• int
• float
• double
As this class doesn’t need to store anything at all, it must not be instantiable by users.
Except for char parameters, only the decimal notation will be used.
Examples of char literals: ’c’, ’a’, ...
To make things simple, please note that non-displayable characters shouldn’t be used as
inputs. If a conversion to char is not displayable, print an informative message.
Examples of int literals: 0, -42, 42...
Examples of float literals: 0.0f, -4.2f, 4.2f...
You have to handle these pseudo-literals as well (you know, for science): -inff, +inff,
and nanf.
Examples of double literals: 0.0, -4.2, 4.2...
You have to handle these pseudo-literals as well (you know, for fun): -inf, +inf, and
nan

Write a program to test that your class works as expected.
You have to first detect the type of the literal passed as a parameter, convert it from
string to its actual type, then convert it explicitly to the three other data types. Lastly,
display the results as shown below.
If a conversion does not make any sense or overflows, display a message to inform
the user that the type conversion is impossible. Include any header you need in order to
handle numeric limits and special values.
./convert 0
char: Non displayable
int: 0
float: 0.0f
double: 0.0
./convert nan
char: impossible
int: impossible
float: nanf
double: nan
./convert 42.0f
char: '*'
int: 42
float: 42.0f
double: 42.0
