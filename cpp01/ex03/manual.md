# Exercise Explanation

This exercise demonstrates the interaction between classes in C++ using a simple example of a weapon system with two types of humans: `HumanA` and `HumanB`. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how the code works.

## Overview

1. **Classes Involved**:
   - `Weapon`: Represents a weapon with a type.
   - `HumanA`: Represents a human that has a weapon and can attack with it.
   - `HumanB`: Represents a human that can set a weapon and attack with it.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It contains two blocks that demonstrate the functionality of `HumanA` and `HumanB`.

### 2. Demonstrating HumanA

- **Weapon Creation**:
  - A `Weapon` object named `club` is created with the type "crude spiked club".
  
- **HumanA Creation**:
  - A `HumanA` object named `bob` is created, initialized with the name "Bob" and the previously created `club` weapon.

- **First Attack**:
  - `bob.attack()` is called, which outputs: "Bob attacks with their crude spiked club".

- **Changing Weapon Type**:
  - The type of the `club` weapon is changed to "some other type of club".

- **Second Attack**:
  - `bob.attack()` is called again, which now outputs: "Bob attacks with their some other type of club".

### 3. Demonstrating HumanB

- **Weapon Creation**:
  - Another `Weapon` object named `club` is created with the same initial type "crude spiked club".

- **HumanB Creation**:
  - A `HumanB` object named `jim` is created, initialized with the name "Jim". Initially, `jim` has no weapon.

- **Setting Weapon**:
  - The `setWeapon` method is called on `jim`, passing the `club` weapon. Now, `jim` has a weapon to use.

- **First Attack**:
  - `jim.attack()` is called, which outputs: "Jim attacks with their crude spiked club".

- **Changing Weapon Type**:
  - The type of the `club` weapon is changed to "some other type of club".

- **Second Attack**:
  - `jim.attack()` is called again, which now outputs: "Jim attacks with their some other type of club".

### Conclusion

This exercise illustrates how objects can interact in C++ through references and pointers. `HumanA` directly holds a reference to a `Weapon`, while `HumanB` holds a pointer to a `Weapon`, demonstrating different ways to manage relationships between objects in C++.
