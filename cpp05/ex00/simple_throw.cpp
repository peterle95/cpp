/*Let me break down exactly what's happening in your simple `throw()` example program, step by step:

1. The program starts executing at `main()`
2. It enters the `try` block
3. It calls `safeFunction()`
   - `safeFunction()` prints "This function won't throw exceptions"
   - `safeFunction()` completes normally and returns to `main()`
4. Next, `main()` calls `unsafeFunction()`
   - Inside `unsafeFunction()`, it executes `throw std::runtime_error("An error occurred")`
   - This creates a new `std::runtime_error` object with the message "An error occurred"
   - The C++ runtime starts unwinding the stack to find a suitable `catch` block
5. Since the exception was thrown inside the `try` block, control jumps to the matching `catch` block
   - The `catch (const std::exception& e)` catches the exception (since `
   std::runtime_error` inherits from `std::exception`)
   - Inside the catch block, `e.what()` calls the `what()` method of the exception, which returns "An error occurred"
   - The program prints "Caught exception: An error occurred"
6. After executing the `catch` block, the program continues execution after the entire try-catch construct
7. It reaches `return 0;` and the program terminates successfully

The key things happening here:

- The function marked with `throw()` (safeFunction) doesn't throw any exceptions, as promised
- The function without any exception specification (unsafeFunction) throws an exception
- The try-catch mechanism successfully catches and handles the exception
- The program demonstrates proper exception handling flow in C++

This illustrates how exception handling works in C++ and how the `throw()` 
specification serves as a contract that a function won't throw exceptions.*/
